o Input Handler
o Audio
Question 11
What is the top reason for using ECS over straightforward OOP in your app architecture.
• There are lots of different virtual objects created at runtime
o All virtual objects can be constructed when the app starts
o Different virtual entities have vastly different features
o ECS has much better performance
o The features in each entity need to constantly share information
