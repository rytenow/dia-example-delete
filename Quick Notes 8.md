aircraft, what device is optimal for this use case?
o Desktop
o Google Cardboard
• Meta Quest 2 (wireless)
o HTC Vive Pro (wired)
o Microsoft HoloLens
Question 11
You are tasked to build a VR cycling game that can be played on a real bike on a stationary trainer, that places you on 
equal standing against elite cycling professionals in a virtual Tour de France. If we are aiming for maximum 
immersion with augmented natural interactions, what device is optimal for this use case?
